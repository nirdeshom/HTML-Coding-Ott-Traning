            The class teacher
            PQR Higher Primary School
            Delhi.
            Date: 1.12.24
            Subject: Sick leave for a week

                My daughter, ABC, has been admitted to the hospital due to food poisoning. She wonâ€™t
                be able to attend classes for a week, as she is advised to take complete rest. 
                I request that you understand her situation and grant her leave from the 1st to the 7th of December. 
                I have attached her medical certificate for your reference. 
                I assure you that she will complete all her assigned duties once she recovers.

            Thank you
            Yours sincerely,
            SRT
